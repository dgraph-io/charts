# Ratel

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add dgraph https://charts.dgraph.io
helm install "my-ratel" --namespace "my-ratel" dgraph/ratel
```

## Introduction

Ratel is a [SPA](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) ([single-page-application](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) [React](https://react.dev/) client that runs locally from your web browser.  The server component is a small web server that hosts the client application, which is then downloaed into your browser locally. There is no server-to-server connection. 


### Prequisites

* Kubernetes 1.20+
* Helm 3.0+
* Dgraph v21.12.0+

### Restricting Ratel

For best practices in security, it is recommended that you install Ratel separately instead of bundled together with the Dgraph.  This small web server should be installed in a namespace that is separate from Dgraph server. If your Kubernetes cluster supports the [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) feature, such as [Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/), you can use these to restrict traffic between the web service hosting Ratel and Dgraph servers.

Given this, use thie helm chart to install Ratel separately from Dgraph

### Accessing Ratel

In order for the Ratel client to connect to the Dgraph Alpha server, you can connect through a tunnel, such as VPN, or connect Dgraph Alpha to an endpoint, such as [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) of type [LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) or use an [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource.  See Dgraph helm chart for further information on such configurations.

## Configuration
